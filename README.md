## COVID-19 Models

At [Produvia](https://produvia.com), our vision is to detect symptomatic cases of the coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, with 99% accuracy. We aim to accomplish this by developing two deep learning models:

1. **COVID-19 Diagnosis** ([Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/task/covid-19-detection))
2. **COVID-19 Image Segmentation** ([Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/task/covid-19-image-segmentation))

## COVID-19 Datasets

We intend to use publically-available coronavirus datasets:

1. **COVID-19 Image Data Collection** ([Dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11597))

   Description: A database of COVID-19 cases with chest X-ray or CT images.

	```

2. **COVIDx** ([Dataset](https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net))
